Applications are added to the whitelist using the "Publisher" rule type using the Issuing CA and Publisher. This is an acceptable method of whitelisting as per the Australian Cyber Security Centre's guidelines on Application Control:

All applications are added with the Usermode and Kernel Rule Scope and are created in Audit Mode.
