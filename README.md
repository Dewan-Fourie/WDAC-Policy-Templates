This repository contains the XML files generated by WDAC Wizard.

All Policy Templates contain the following policy rules:
- Advanced Boot Options Menu
- Disable Script Enforcement
- Managed Installer (Allows automated whitelisting through Intune Deployment)
- Update Policy without Rebooting
- Unsigned System Integrity Policy
- User Mode Code Integrity
- Treat Recoked as Unsigned
- Boot Audit on Failure
- Disabled Runtime Filepath Rules

Applications are whitelisted using either Cryptographic Hashing or using the publisher and product name part of the program's certificate if signed. 
This is an acceptable method of whitelisting as per the Australian Cyber Security Centre's guidelines on Application Control:
- Cryptographic hash rules
- Publisher certificate rules (combining both publisher names and product names)
- Path rules (ensuring file system permissions are configured to prevent unauthorised modification of folder and file permissions, folder contents and individual files).

All applications are added with the Usermode and Kernel Rule Scope and are created in Audit Mode.

WDAC Wizard's Policy Editor or Policy Merger functionality can be used to edit or combine the policy templates respectively.
